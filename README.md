# Javascript-Complete-Shopping-Cart-Project-Made-with-Vanilla-JS-CSS-HTML-
This Projects features a lot of functions I will love developers to explore,  the functions ranges from the add items cart to 
having the added cart items on another page i.e the cart page is entirely another page, it is there not a single page shopping cart
project. On the items page or main web page once an item is added to cart, it can no longer be added to cart but the quantity can be 
increased from the cart page.  For neatnessness and simplicity an array was created to contain the each product information and
The cart logo increments the number of items in cart once another item is added to cart,  now concerning the cart page, I have added some
functionalities which includes incrementing or decrementing the quantity of each item, removing item from cart, as the quantity of an item
increases,  the total price increases, the unit total also increases and the no of item in cart logo also increases. 
If a user decides to shop more before purchasing he/she can decide to go back to the shopping page and also if he decides to clear everything  
from cart,  he can and lastly he can also use to purchase the button to display a thank you message and to clear the cart.  
Below is the breakdown of the functions of this project into list
